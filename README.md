# Fluid-Simulation
Based on SPH & marching cube algorithm, we simulate two different particles for multiple fluid and mix them together. We also resort to RenderMan for better display. Later on, we implement mesh collision detection between objects and fluid by Moller-Trumbore ray-triangle intersection algorithm.
