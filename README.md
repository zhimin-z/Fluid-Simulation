# Fluid-Simulation
Based on SPH & marching cube algorithm, we simulate two different particles for multiple fluid and mix them together for [CIS 563 - Phys Based Animation](https://www.coursicle.com/penn/courses/CIS/563/) 2015 Spring Project 2. We also resort to RenderMan for better display. Later on, we implement mesh collision detection between objects and fluid by Moller-Trumbore ray-triangle intersection algorithm.
